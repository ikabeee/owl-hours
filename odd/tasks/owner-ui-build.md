# Build the owner UI from the handoff (delegated, test-first)

Restructure `apps/owner` to the screaming architecture (features managed by
components, copys, services, hooks, lib) and build the demo path slice by
slice, delegated with test-first discipline.

## Specs

- S1: app architecture is screaming: `features/` per business flow, each with
  `components/`, `copys/`, `services/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`; `app/` stays thin.
- S2: services are consumed only through hooks; components never import services.
- S3: tests are planned per iteration and reviewed by the user after each one.
- S4: every technical decision is documented (`docs/DECISIONS.md`).

## Tasks

- T1: this doc + handoff + DECISIONS seed, S1-S4, route: inline
- T2: restructure to features×5-concerns (behavior-preserving), S1-S2
- T3: requests slice: countdown lib + offers service + hook + copys, S2-S3,
  route: delegated (Claude Sonnet 5.5, effort high, user's choice), branch
  `feat/owner-requests-slice`, status: done (GREEN)
- T4: chats slice (polish), S2-S3, route: delegated (Claude Sonnet 5.5,
  effort high, user's choice), branch `feat/owner-chats-slice`, status:
  done (GREEN)
- T4.1: fix the 6 T4 review follow-ups (L14), S2-S3, route: delegated (user:
  "deja agentes desarrollando"), 2 parallel units with disjoint surfaces:
  U1 chats (items 1, 2, 4, 5, 6), U2 requests (item 3); Sonnet 5.5 high,
  status: done (GREEN)
- T3.1: request evidence + possible faults, S2-S3, route: delegated (Claude
  Sonnet 5.5, effort high), branch `feat/owner-request-evidence`
- T5: jobs slice: quote modal + job detail + chat SuggestionRow entry,
  S2-S3, route: delegated (Claude Sonnet 5.5, effort high, same flow as
  T3/T4), branch `feat/owner-jobs-quote`, status: done (GREEN)
- T5.1: Jobs list (`OwJobs`) + finish (`OwJobDone`) + jobs-only shared
  store, S2-S3, route: delegated (Claude Sonnet 5.5, effort high, same flow
  as T5), branch `feat/owner-jobs-list`, coder: Muse (GREEN), status: done (GREEN, 11294f9 + ccf37eb)
- T5.2: the sent quote as a message in the chat thread (needs a store shared
  by chats and jobs), S2-S3, route: delegated (Claude Sonnet 5.5, effort
  high, same flow as T5.1), branch `feat/owner-quote-message` stacked on
  `feat/owner-jobs-list` (#30 open), status: done (GREEN)
- T6: content + business slices, S2-S3

## Log

- L1 (user): plan approved with services added; start delegating; plan tests
  for review per iteration; document every technical decision.
- L2 (user): no Claude subscription plan; coders = this session's subagents
  unless redirected.
- L3 (user): roster = Muse Spark 1.3 contributor + agy (Gemini 3.8 Flash).
  Decisions D1-D5 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- L4: T2 done by agy (moves to `features/*/components/`, imports + tsconfig
  fixed); operator verified: owner tsc clean, export OK, npm test 15/15,
  root typecheck clean. Uncommitted. Next: T3 (requests slice) — Spark 1.3
  contributor takes it from `docs/HANDOFF-OWNER-APP.md`; tests reviewed by
  the user before implementation starts.
- L5: T3 assignment written into `docs/HANDOFF-OWNER-APP.md` (edit surface,
  3 named test files with demo literals, RED→stop-for-review). No Spark 1.3
  entry point exists in this session (no peer session, no CLI), so the
  contributor must be launched by the user; agy remains launchable here.
- L6 (close this PR): shell + T2 foundation ships as one PR for review. T3–T6
  stay queued in `docs/HANDOFF-OWNER-APP.md`; they are not part of this PR.
  UI verified live at `http://localhost:8097/request/req_ana` (HTTP 200).
  Status stays `in-progress` until T3–T6 land.
- L7 (user, 2026-10-28): "Usaremos claude sonnet 5.5 en high siguien el
  mismo flujo de ODD". Before launch the operator fixed two defects in the
  T3 assignment: the `secondsLeft` example used `expiresAt` 00:05:00 (past
  `now`, so 0, not 272); corrected to `req_ana.expiresAt` 00:10:00. The
  owner `test` script ran only `lib/tonight.test.ts`; the coder widens it to
  include `features/**/*.test.ts` (added to the edit surface). Open for T3:
  whether an `offered` offer past `expiresAt` can be accepted (not specified).
- L8 (user, 2026-10-28): "Sí, apruebo los tests, bloquéalos y pasa al
  GREEN". Approval covers the operator's answers to the RED open questions:
  (1) no clock in the service; the hook disables Accept at 0:00 and the
  backend owns the final rule; (2) design strings the screen does not render
  today stay out of T3; (3) the `RequestsScreen` list placeholder stays out
  of T3. Tests locked via `.claude/tests.lock`. GREEN edit surface adds
  `app/request/[id].tsx` (the route must wire the hook; it holds a hardcoded
  offer today). Operator finding for GREEN: `RequestScreen.tsx:45` hardcodes
  `max={300}`; derive it from `acceptWindowMin` (urgent 5 / other 30 min).
- L9 (2026-10-28): T3 GREEN by the Sonnet 5.5 coder; locked tests unchanged.
  Operator review fix: hook `accept`/`decline` now return a boolean and the
  route navigates only after a successful transition (previously it
  navigated to the chat even when the offer was no longer `offered`).
  Gates: owner `npm test` 30/30, owner tsc clean, `expo export` OK
  (binary at `apps/owner/node_modules/.bin/expo`), root `npm test` 3/3,
  root typecheck 5/5. Lock removed. Not checked: the first "4:32" frame on a
  real render (no device/browser run). Next: T4 chats slice.
- L10 (user, 2026-10-28): "Delégalo a Sonnet 5.5 en high, mismo flujo".
  T4 assignment written into `docs/HANDOFF-OWNER-APP.md`. Operator findings:
  `app/chat/[id].tsx` is missing although `app/request/[id].tsx:25`
  navigates there (added to the GREEN surface). Correction: the operator
  claimed `mock.ts` had no `c_ana` thread; it exports `anaMessages` (m1, m2)
  at `shared/data/mock.ts:71` (coder found it).
- L11 (2026-10-28): T4 RED by the Sonnet 5.5 coder: 43 new tests fail
  (8 lib, 15 service, 20 copys), existing 30 pass, owner tsc clean. Lib and
  service tests fail on stub throws, copys on assertions. 9 open questions
  pending user review.
- L12 (user, 2026-10-28): "Sí, apruébalos con esas respuestas, bloquéalos y
  pasa a GREEN". Tests adjusted (B label = HANDOFF §8 string, seed =
  `anaMessages`), RED 71/30/41, locked. GREEN by the coder (one run lost to
  a network error, resumed): owner `npm test` 73/73 (operator re-ran),
  owner tsc clean, `expo export` OK, root test + typecheck green. Operator
  finding (open): `app/request/[id].tsx:25` navigates to `c_${offerId}` =
  `c_req_ana`, but the conversation id is `c_ana`, so Accept opens a blank
  chat. "You accepted at" uses device-local `toLocaleTimeString`.
- L13 (user, 2026-10-29): chose "Accept returns conv". Operator, inline and
  test-first: new `offersService.chat.test.ts` (4 tests) RED with
  `findChat is not a function`, then GREEN. Added `findChat` +
  `findConversationId`; the hook `accept` returns the chat id; the route
  navigates with it. Gates: owner `npm test` 77/77, owner tsc clean,
  `expo export` OK, root `npm test` 3/3 tasks, root typecheck 5/5. D7 and D8
  in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. Lock removed. Not checked: chat screen on a real
  render (no device/browser run). Pending (handoff retirement rule):
  `OwChat`/`OwChatPolish` design pairs stay until the screen is verified
  visually (same as `OwRequest` after T3). Next: T5 jobs slice (quote).
- L14 (2026-10-29): RDD review of `34267d2..ef12f65` (medium; user granted).
  One lens (reliability), approved and acknowledged. Non-blocking follow-ups:
  (1) `sendChoice` has no in-flight guard, so a double tap sends twice;
  (2) polish-off `send` does not catch a rejection, so the draft is lost;
  (3) accept succeeds but navigation is skipped when no chat maps to the offer;
  (4) an empty thread renders "You accepted at Invalid Date";
  (5) the `useConversation` state machine has no test;
  (6) a failed load leaves a blank screen.
- L15 (user, 2026-10-29): "Corrige esos 6 puntos, deja agentes
  desarrollando". Item 5 (untested hook) is solved by extracting the
  composer state machine into a pure `lib/` reducer tested with node --test
  (the repo has no React test setup). Item 3 fallback: when an accepted offer
  maps to no chat, navigate to the chats tab instead of staying put.
- L16 (2026-10-29): T4.1 RED was 51 new tests (U1 48, U2 3), reviewed by the
  operator and locked. The operator accepted the coders' proposals: a
  framework-free session module, no reload after a send, and the failed-send
  copy reused from §466. Both units reached GREEN in parallel; neither touched
  a locked test, and each diff stayed in its surface.
  Seam check (operator):
  - owner `npm test`: 128/128;
  - owner tsc: clean;
  - `expo export`: OK;
  - root `npm test`: 3/3;
  - root typecheck: 5/5.
  D9 is in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. The lock is removed.
  Open items:
  - `not_found` renders blank, because the handoff has no copy for it;
  - none of this was run on a device or browser.
  Next: T5 jobs slice.
- L17 (2026-10-29): RDD review of the whole branch `34267d2..89b37ba` (medium;
  user granted). One lens (reliability), approved and acknowledged.
  Non-blocking follow-ups:
  (1) `useRequestOffer.ts:63-67`: a rejected `findChat` after a committed
  accept leaves the owner on the request screen;
  (2) `ChatScreen.tsx:203-206`: restoring the draft overwrites text typed
  while a send was in flight, including after a refused second tap.
- L18 (user, 2026-10-29): "Manda los PR's bajas maestro con el emulador de
  IOS (ya ando en mi casa) para que hagas e2e de las pantallas y me muestres
  los resultados. Antes de mandar PRs me mandas los ss".
  Setup:
  - iOS 27 simulator runtime downloaded;
  - "Zukki iPhone" simulator (iPhone 16) created;
  - Expo Go installed through `expo start --ios`;
  - Maestro with JAVA_HOME=openjdk@17.
  Flows are in `apps/owner/.maestro/`.
  Shell bugs found and fixed (both predate T4):
  - Expo Router 58 renders only the screens a layout declares, and
    `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` declared none (blank app); TABS is now exported
    and declared;
  - "/" had no route, so a cold start landed on Jobs; `app/index.tsx` now
    redirects to `/requests`.
  E2E result: 4/6 pass (tabs, request detail, accept→chat, decline).
  Open findings:
  - (a) ChatScreen renders at about half width and the accepted-at line is
    clipped ("AM");
  - (b) Maestro `inputText` cannot type into the WebView composer, so
    option A and option B are not verified e2e;
  - (c) replacing a DOM screen while it loads logs "Unable to find the
    'DomWebView' view with tag" (dev LogBox);
  - (d) the Requests tab is still a placeholder.
- L19 (user, 2026-10-29): "corrije el layout".
  - Root cause: in the native DOM host, `.zukki-root` is a flex item that
    shrinks to its content width. ChatLayout's `container-type: inline-size`
    contributes 0, so the TopBar (~170 pt) set the width. Chromium web and
    iOS Safari render full width.
  - Fix: `width: 100%` on the ChatScreen root.
  - Verified in Expo Go on the iOS simulator: full width, and "You accepted
    at 12:05 AM" is intact.
  - E2E: option B now passes end to end, since typing works at full width.
  - Flaky: option A and accept→chat failed once. In one, the tap on Send
    landed on the dev LogBox toast ("Unable to find the 'DomWebView' view").
    In the other, the WebView accessibility tree was missing a visible text.
  - Observation: after a send, the new bubble sits under the dock until the
    owner scrolls; the scroll-down button shows.
- L20 (user, 2026-10-29): "Arregla el scrol".
  - Cause: ChatLayout follows new content only while locked at the bottom
    (`useChatStreamScroll`). Keyboard and dock resizes unlock it, so the
    owner's new bubble stayed under the dock.
  - Fix: `arrivedOwnMessage` (pure, `lib/followLatest.ts`, 5 tests,
    RED→GREEN) drives `FollowOwnMessages`, which scrolls ChatLayout's
    `scrollContainerRef` to the end after each own send. Reduced motion
    jumps instead of smooth-scrolling.
  - Verified: option A passed alone on the simulator; the "On my way, 12:55
    · sent as written" bubble is visible above the dock with the keyboard
    open.
  - Flow hardening:
    - the subflow passes through /requests to remount the target;
    - Enter submits instead of a Send tap.
  - Still flaky in the full suite: dev LogBox "Unable to find the
    'DomWebView' view" errors stack up across navigations and cover the
    screen. Unit tests: 133/133.
- L21 (user, 2026-10-29): "Por que esta ese error?" then "Sí, haz las tres".
  - Cause: expo@58 `src/dom/webview-wrapper.tsx` `emit()` calls
    `injectJavaScript` (an iOS AsyncFunction in
    `@expo/dom-webview/ios/DomWebViewModule.swift:133`) without a catch.
    When the WebView is already unmounted, expo-modules-core rejects with
    "Unable to find the 'DomWebView' view with tag".
  - Our triggers:
    - DOM actions that navigate before returning (Accept, Decline, Back);
    - fast deep-link navigation (e2e).
  - (1) `shared/navigation/leaveAfterReturning` defers navigation one
    macrotask (2 tests, RED→GREEN, node mock timers). It is used by the
    request and chat routes. The test script now includes
    `shared/**/*.test.ts`.
  - (2) `LogBox.ignoreLogs` for exactly that message in `app/_layout.tsx`;
    it still reaches the console.
  - (3) Upstream: #50679 (same bug, Android) was closed by expo-bot for a
    missing repro, not fixed; #49173 (Android cold start) is open. Ours
    reproduces on iOS. A valid report needs a public minimal repro repo,
    which awaits the user's go-ahead.
  - Flows:
    - wait on "Message input" (a stable a11y label);
    - close the keyboard ("Done") before tapping Send, inside `retry`,
      because the accessory bar covers Send.
  - E2E: 6/6 in the final full run; the chat flows passed 3/3 in
    isolation. Unit tests: 135/135.
  - Note: XCUITest typing into the WebView once dropped the last character
    ("12:5").
- L22 (user, 2026-10-29): "Go ahead y muestra las evidencias ademas
  necesito las capturas de los tests e2e en el historial de git".
  - E2E screenshots are committed in `apps/owner/.maestro/evidence/`
    (f12f6cc).
  - Upstream repro https://github.com/ikabeee/expo-dom-ios-mount-rejection-repro
    shows that mounting one DOM component rejects on 3 of 3 iOS cold starts.
    It needs no interaction or navigation. Issue
    https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/52503.
  - Correction to L21: the repro's navigate-inside-action tap did NOT
    reject (error count unchanged), so the real cause is the mount race of
    the `$$props` `emit`, not unmount. `leaveAfterReturning` therefore had
    no proven effect and is reverted. `ignoreLogs` stays, with its comment
    pointing to #52503.
  - After the revert: E2E 6/6, unit 133/133, tsc clean.
- L23 (2026-10-29): stacked PRs to main, cut at the commit boundaries:
  - #15 T4 chats slice (`feat/owner-chats-t4`, +1052/-7);
  - #16 T4.1 review fixes (`fix/owner-chats-t4-review`, +1051/-136);
  - #17 iOS e2e fixes plus evidence (`fix/owner-ios-e2e`, +359/-5).
  #15 and #16 request `size:exception`: each is one work unit, about half
  tests, and splitting them means rewriting history. Merge order:
  #15 → #16 → #17. Next: T5 jobs slice.
- L24 (2026-10-29): RDD review of the whole stack (user granted).
  - Blocking finding, CRITICAL, R3-polish-failed-draft-lost: with polish
    on, a failed polish lost the draft because Composer unmounts while
    polishing.
  - Correction 5ff2753, 20 lines: the draft is lifted into Footer, which
    stays mounted.
  - Validation: the first validator run died ("transport failed: signal:
    killed"); the same slot was reoffered and the second run approved.
    Acknowledged.
  - Checks: unit 133/133, tsc clean; e2e A, B and accept 3/3.
  - Non-blocking follow-ups:
    (1) a rejected `findChat` after a committed accept leaves the owner
    stranded;
    (2) restoring the draft overwrites text typed during an in-flight send;
    (3) `not_found` chat is a blank screen.
- L25 (user, 2026-10-29): "hay demasiado padding en las pantallas", "Muchos
  espacios en blanco", "No necesitamos un switch para polish, sino que sea
  un icono que cargue y muestra a zukki interactuando", "copia este layout
  de whatsapp pero manteniendo el mismo estilo de ui", "esta perfecto,
  mientras pule zukki debe estar 'trabajando'".
  - Padding: the DOM routes pass `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior: 'never'`.
    Expo's wrapper default "automatic" added the safe area on top of the
    screens' own insets.
  - White space: ChatLayout `density="compact"`.
  - Composer:
    - an Astryx InputGroup pill (`.zukki-pill` sets `--radius-element`)
      holding the Zukki owl IconButton toggle (`aria-pressed`) and a
      TextInput labelled "Message";
    - a round primary Send outside the pill;
    - while polishing the owl runs in color (`aria-busy`, not disabled) and
      the field shows "Polishing…";
    - the Switch is removed.
  - Checks: E2E 6/6 (flows tap "Message" index 1), unit 133/133, tsc clean.
- L26 (user, 2026-10-29): "Haz squash and merge, y empezamos una nuvea
  sesion".
  - #15 → #16 → #17 → #18 are squash-merged into main in order. Each
    branch is rebased onto main with `--onto` after the previous squash.
  - Upstream: expo/expo#52503 (issue) and expo/expo#52509 (fix PR). Remove
    `LogBox.ignoreLogs` in `app/_layout.tsx` once a release ships the fix.
  - Open follow-ups from the reviews:
    - a rejected `findChat` after a committed accept strands the owner;
    - restoring the draft overwrites text typed during an in-flight send;
    - `not_found` chat is a blank screen;
    - the message field is single-line.
  - Next: T5 jobs slice (quote). E2E runs with Maestro on the "Zukki
    iPhone" simulator: `npx expo start --ios` in `apps/owner`, then
    `maestro test .maestro` with JAVA_HOME=openjdk@17.
- L27 (user, 2026-10-29): "me referia al handoff que se le enviaba al
  owner business en la app" / "Agrega también la lista de posibles fallas.
  Y tenemos que agregarlo a la UI".
  - Gap: HANDOFF-RN-UI §8 "Request detail" asks for "video `Thumbnail`
    (→ `Lightbox`)", "the customer's quote in italics" and "`ZukkiTag` +
    summary". T3's RequestScreen renders only the title, name, distance and
    zukkiSummary.
  - New requirement (not in the handoff): a structured list of possible
    faults on the request.
- L28 (user, 2026-10-29): "Go".
  - T3.1 RED approved: 23 new tests, 20 failing; existing 133 green.
  - Approved answers:
    - the media banner is the Astryx `Thumbnail` sized to the design's
      326×128 via `style`;
    - the ZukkiTag avatar reuses the owl `static` frame (no new binary);
    - the Lightbox shows the thumbnail with "Video · 0:14" (no real video in
      the demo);
    - the sent time is device-local, as in D7.
  - New copy approved: "Possible faults", "Likely", "Possible", "Photo".
  - Tests locked (`t3.1-request-evidence`).
- L29 (2026-10-29): T3.1 GREEN.
  - The coder built the evidence UI, the possible faults list (Badge) and
    `sortLikelyFirst` / `mediaDurationText` in lib.
  - The operator added the sticky bottom action bar: the longer card had
    pushed Decline / Accept and chat off screen, and 3 e2e flows failed
    until it was in place.
  - New e2e flow `07-request-evidence`.
  - Checks: unit 156/156, tsc clean, e2e 7/7.
  - D10 is in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. Lock removed.
- L30 (2026-10-29): RDD review of T3.1 (medium; user granted). One lens
  (reliability), approved and acknowledged. Non-blocking follow-ups:
  (1) no test drives `useRequestOffer` to prove sorted faults or the
      empty-list default;
  (2) `CustomerMedia` renders a blank banner for any media that is not
      the demo frame (no fallback);
  (3) the alt text always says "video frame", even for photos;
  (4) an unknown likelihood value would throw;
  (5) "Sent by Zukki" shows device-local time, unasserted by e2e.
- L31 (user, 2026-10-29): "Sí, corrige la 2 y abre el PR".
  - Follow-up (2) fixed: `lib/mediaFrameSource` (4 tests, RED→GREEN)
    resolves a demo id to its frame and keeps https/data URLs; anything
    else returns null.
  - `CustomerMedia` then shows only the caption, so no blank banner is
    drawn. The lightbox hook moved into `MediaBanner`, which mounts only
    when there is a frame.
  - Checks: unit 160/160, tsc clean, request e2e flows 3/3.
- L32 (2026-10-29): RDD review of T3.1 plus the banner fix (user granted),
  approved and acknowledged.
  - It found that `mediaFrameSource` resolved inherited property names
    ("constructor") to a Function.
  - Fixed with `Object.hasOwn` (3 tests, RED→GREEN; unit 163/163).
  - Still open from the review:
    - no test drives the hook;
    - the photo alt text says "video" (now reachable with real URLs);
    - an unknown likelihood throws;
    - the sent time is device-local.
- L33 (user, 2026-10-29): "Corrígelos en este PR y haz squash and merge".
  - The remaining review follow-ups are fixed test-first: 9 tests,
    RED→GREEN, unit 172/172.
  - Hook boundary: `lib/requestFaults` returns faults likely first,
    defaults to [], and maps an unknown likelihood to "possible". The hook
    uses it, so the screen never hits an unknown badge.
  - Alt text: `lib/mediaAltText` gives a video "Frame from the customer's
    video" and a photo "Photo from the customer" (new copy).
  - Sent time: `lib/sentTimeText` uses the wall clock in the timestamp's
    own offset ("12:05 AM" on any device). A malformed timestamp shows just
    "Sent by Zukki".
  - E2E 7/7.
- L34 (user, 2026-10-29): "Vamos con T5"; scope chosen: "Quote + detail".
  - T5 = `OwQuote` (modal, `chat/[id]/quote`) + `OwJob` (`job/[id]`) + the
    `SuggestionRow` "Review" in the chat, so the demo path reaches the quote
    and "View job and evidence" stops being a no-op.
  - `OwJobs` and `OwJobDone` move to T5.1.
  - Assignment: `docs/HANDOFF-OWNER-APP.md` "T5 assignment".
- L35 (user, 2026-10-29): Q2 "Simulated approval (Recommended)"; the rest
  approved with the operator's answers.
  - RED by the coder: 87 new tests, 86 failing; existing 172 green; tsc
    clean (operator re-ran: 259/173/86).
  - Answers:
    - (1) `on_site` shows "Finish" disabled until T5.1; pre-approval statuses
      show a disabled button with no next status;
    - (2) `sendQuote` marks `quoted`; the demo fake client then approves for
      Ana (`customer_approved` + "Quote sent and approved"); the real service
      stops at `quoted`;
    - (3) refusals return `null`; the hook gates "Send quote" with
      `canSendQuote`;
    - (4) `updateJobStatus` allows only the next owner step; `done` is T5.1;
    - (5) new copy approved: "Use whole numbers above 0. The first number
      can't be higher than the second.";
    - (6)-(7) copy templated by first name and distance; `Job` gains optional
      `approvedAt` and `distanceKm` (`shared/data`, additive);
    - (8) pending timeline steps derived from the status;
    - (9) duplicated helpers (clock time, first name, money range) move to
      `shared/lib/` now;
    - (10) a failed suggestion lookup means "no suggestion";
    - (11) `getQuoteDraft("c_carlos")` is `null`.
- L36 (user, 2026-10-29): "Approve and go GREEN".
  - Adjusted RED: 268 tests, 94 failing, existing 172 green, tsc clean;
    `shared/lib` 10/10 failing (not yet in the `test` script).
  - Answers: footer hidden before approval, "Finish" disabled at `done`;
    `en_route` appends "On the way" (new RED test file); both steps pending
    before approval; one approval entry; distance as a number; no distance
    → "Shared after Ana approved".
  - Tests locked (`t5-jobs-quote`).
- L37 (2026-10-29): T5 GREEN by the coder; no locked test touched.
  - Gates: owner `npm test` 306/306 (script now includes `shared/**`),
    owner tsc clean, `expo export --platform ios` OK. Root `npm test` and
    typecheck fail only in `api`, `whatsapp` and `meta-models` on missing
    installs (`packages/whatsapp` has no `node_modules`); environmental,
    not this diff.
  - Operator e2e review found two defects, fixed inline:
    - "Review" was truncated ("Revi…"): `SuggestionRow` now lets the text
      wrap and keeps the button's width;
    - "On the way" read 12:05 AM, before the 12:07 approval: the jobs demo
      clock now starts at 12:07 (test-first, `demoJobsService.test.ts`).
  - E2E: full suite 8/9 (`03-accept-opens-chat` flaky, passed alone);
    08 and 09 pass. Evidence: `.maestro/evidence/2026-10-29-jobs-quote/`.
  - `OwQuote` handoff pair retired; `OwJob` stays until T5.1 builds Finish.
  - D11 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. Lock removed.
  - Not covered: a rejected `getQuoteDraft`/`getJob` leaves a blank screen
    (no error state yet).
- L38 (user, 2026-10-29): "Abre PR pero muestrame los outputs e2e de la
  UI". PR #23 (`feat/owner-jobs-quote`, 3dffc57 + ecd31bc) with the six
  e2e screenshots inline. Next: T5.1 (Jobs list, finish, shared store).
- L39 (user, 2026-10-30): "empezamos con t5.1, el primer slice ya esta en
  main. hay que hacer una rama derivada de main en un worktree"; then "si"
  to install and write the T5.1 assignment with RED for review.
  - Worktree `owl-hours-worktrees/owner-jobs-list`, branch
    `feat/owner-jobs-list` from `origin/main` a3bb9f8 (#23), upstream unset.
    Owner deps via `/tmp/pnpm10 install --frozen-lockfile`.
  - Store scope: "Jobs-only (Recommended)": one demo jobs service shared by
    the jobs screens; Carlos and the Tomorrow jobs seeded in `mock.ts`; the
    quote message in the chat moves to T5.2.
  - Assignment: `docs/HANDOFF-OWNER-APP.md` "T5.1 assignment".
- L40 (user, 2026-10-30): "Arrance y deja a muse trabajando como coder".
  - RED by the Sonnet coder: 16 new test files; 390 tests, 311 pass, 79
    fail; existing 306 green; tsc errors only from missing code (operator
    re-ran: 390/311/79).
  - Answers approved (Q1-Q11 of the RED report): "Upcoming" count derived
    from the jobs (2 today, design says 3; D22); technician on the card from
    `customer_approved` on; new copy "Outside the $130–160 estimate. Tell
    Ana why.", "Why is the price different?", "No jobs tonight.", "No
    upcoming jobs.", "No finished jobs yet."; status lines "On the way",
    "On site", "Done · $145"; a range line starts at its midpoint, rounded
    down; optional `Job.scheduledFor` and `Job.finalPriceReason`;
    `finishJob` appends "Done"; `listJobs()`, `finishJob(id, { amounts,
    reason?, asksToSharePhotos })`, `JobView.canFinish`;
    `sharedDemoJobsService()`, `sharedDemoNow()`,
    `resetSharedDemoJobsService()`; seeds `carlosJob`, `luciaJob`,
    `graceJob`.
  - Operator updated three superseded T5 tests: `jobAction.test.ts`
    (`on_site` "Finish" enabled), `jobsService.demoClient.test.ts`
    (`c_carlos` has a draft), `jobsService.test.ts` (store client gains
    `listJobs`). RED now 390/309/81. Tests locked (`t5-1-jobs-list`).
  - GREEN coder: Muse (`muse-spark-1.3-contributor`, effort xhigh).
- L41 (2026-10-30): T5.1 GREEN by Muse; no locked test touched (hashes of
  the 64 test files unchanged).
  - Gates (operator re-ran): owner `npm test` 451/451, tsc clean, iOS
    export OK; root `npm test` and `typecheck` now pass too.
  - Review, fix round 1 (Muse): the Jobs list and job detail went stale
    (loaded once, tab stays mounted) -> `reload` on `useFocusEffect` in the
    routes; `jobCardLabel` moved to `lib/`, dead `JobCardRoute` removed;
    Carlos arrival 12:40-1:10 AM (was before his request); `useFinishJob`
    catches a rejected load; `finalTotal` computed once.
  - After fix: owner 452/452 (+1 `jobCardLabel` test), tsc clean.
  - E2E `10-job-finish.yaml` not run by Muse: its sandbox cannot reach the
    simulator.
- L42 (user, 2026-10-30): "Go" (stop the main checkout's Metro, run e2e
  from the worktree); then "Narrower padding (Recommended)".
  - E2E 08, 09, 10 pass in order from a fresh Expo Go. Evidence:
    `apps/owner/.maestro/evidence/2026-10-30-jobs-list/`.
  - Operator fixes inline: flow 10 asserted "Approved · arrive 12:55 AM"
    although 09 leaves Ana `on_site` (now accepts either status line);
    "Upcoming · 2" was truncated by Astryx md side padding in three equal
    segments -> `.zukki-jobs-segments` sets `padding-inline:
    var(--spacing-1) !important` (Astryx atomic rules out-rank any class).
  - Findings: the shared store makes 08-10 order-dependent within one
    Expo Go session (run the suite from a fresh app); Expo Go's DOM webview
    picks up CSS edits only after `expo start --clear`; Maestro needs
    `JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17`.
  - Gates after the fixes: owner 452/452, tsc clean, locked-test hashes
    unchanged. Next: commit the work units, remove the lock.
- L43 (2026-10-30): T5.1 committed on `feat/owner-jobs-list`: 11294f9
  (store, service, seeds, lib), ccf37eb (screens, routes, e2e, handoff
  retirement, D22), plus this log. Lock removed. Native assess: medium,
  not due (`under_budget`). Not pushed. Next: T5.2 (the sent quote as a
  message in the chat thread, store shared by chats and jobs).
- L44 (user, 2026-10-30): "Manda el pr". PR #30 (`feat/owner-jobs-list`,
  11294f9 + ccf37eb + docs) with the e2e screenshots inline.
- L45 (user, 2026-10-30): "arrancamos con t5.2".
  - #30 is still open, so the worktree `owl-hours-worktrees/owner-quote-message`
    branches `feat/owner-quote-message` from `feat/owner-jobs-list` 3bbf74f.
  - No design HTML draws the quote message. Asked; the user chose "Mirror
    WhatsApp (Recommended)": an outgoing bubble with the
    `13-quote.json` header, body, footer and the two buttons as
    non-interactive labels.
  - Assignment: `docs/HANDOFF-OWNER-APP.md` "T5.2 assignment".
- L46 (user, 2026-10-30): "si, apruebo todas" (Q1-Q10 of the T5.2 RED report).
  - RED by the Sonnet coder: 9 new test files; owner 472 tests, 453 pass,
    19 fail (operator re-ran); the 452 existing tests green; tsc errors only
    in the new tests, from missing code.
  - Answers: the body builder and its wording live in
    `shared/lib/quoteMessage.ts` (jobs writes `Message.text`), the chats
    copys reference those constants; the SuggestionRow hides once the
    thread holds a quote message; the reply buttons are non-interactive
    chips (no role, no tab stop, 16px, contrast >= 4.5:1, `data-testid`);
    `getBusinessName()` on the chats service, a failed lookup shows the
    plain text; `sharedX`/`resetSharedX` names, reset clears in place; the
    cross-feature test stays in `features/chats/services/`; the quote
    message has no `delivery`; a re-send appends a second message; a failed
    `reload()` keeps the previous thread.
  - Operator added the Q2 tests (`conversationSession.quoteMessage.test.ts`)
    and deleted the duplicate `features/jobs/lib/arrivalWindow.test.ts`
    (the shared test pins the same two cases). Tests locked
    (`t5-2-quote-message`). GREEN coder: Claude Sonnet 5.5, effort high.
- L47 (user, 2026-10-30): "Fix the test (Recommended)". GREEN by the Sonnet
  coder left one locked test failing: `jobsService.quoteMessage.test.ts`
  expected `sendQuote()` to return the approved job, but it returns the job
  as saved (`quoted`, D11) and the demo approval shows on the next read. The
  operator lifted the lock, changed only that case to read through
  `getJob`, and re-locked; the other 93 test files' hashes are unchanged.
- L48 (2026-10-30): T5.2 GREEN.
  - Gates (operator re-ran): owner `npm test` 493/493, tsc clean; root
    `npm test` and `typecheck` pass; iOS export OK (coder).
  - Review: no blocker. `useConversation` returns `{ conversation, reload }`
    (the route is its only caller); the shared chat service keeps sent
    messages across chat visits in one app session (D23).
  - E2E from the worktree's Metro: 11 (new) passes, with its evidence in
    `apps/owner/.maestro/evidence/2026-10-30-quote-message/`; 04, 05 and 08
    pass, each from a fresh Expo Go opened on the Metro URL. Killing Expo Go
    and running a flow straight away fails its first `openLink`.
  - Decision D23. Lock removed. Next: T6 is already on main (#24, #25), so
    the next open item is the L37 gap (error state for a rejected load).

- L49 (user, 2026-10-30): "Abre pr". PR #57 (`feat/owner-quote-message` ->
  `feat/owner-jobs-list`, stacked on #30; 788dade + f371561 + docs) with the
  before (flow 08) and after (flow 11) screenshots inline. After #30 merges,
  retarget #57 to `main`. Next: the L37 gap (error state for a rejected load).
