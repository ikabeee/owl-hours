# Owl Hours (Zukki) — Running and Demo Tutorial

A task-oriented guide for developers and hackathon judges to run, test, and demo Owl Hours end to end.

---

## 1. What It Is

Owl Hours (Zukki) is an AI assistant for local service businesses that captures urgent customer requests on WhatsApp, provides emergency guidance to mitigate damage, and coordinates instant dispatch and quoting. Every job requires human approval before booking.

Two applications make up the system:
- **Customer Side (WhatsApp / Zukki Agent)**: Direct customer messaging interface on WhatsApp powered by the Cloud API and backend AI worker.
- **Owner App (`apps/owner`)**: Native mobile and web shell built with Expo and Astryx design system where business owners review inbound requests, chat, dispatch quotes, track jobs, and approve social proof content.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Ensure your environment satisfies the following requirements before starting:
- **Node.js**: `v24` (or `v22+` as specified in `railpack.json`)
- **pnpm**: `v10+` (package manager for workspaces)
- **Docker**: Running Docker daemon (required for local Supabase and PostGIS database tests)
- **Supabase CLI**: Accessible via `npx supabase` (bundled in repo scripts)
- **Expo CLI**: Bundled via local npm scripts (`apps/owner/package.json`)

---

## 3. Run Locally End to End

The repository provides an automated script to bring up the entire local backing stack and configure local environment files.

### Step 1: Prepare the API secrets file
The local boot script expects base secrets (WhatsApp and Meta keys) in `apps/api/.env`. Create this file if not already present:
```sh
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
```
*(Values may remain empty or placeholder if WhatsApp sending is not configured; local mock webhooks bypass external Meta connectivity).*

### Step 2: Start the local stack
Run the local stack boot script:
```sh
bash scripts/local/up.sh
```
This script performs the following automatically:
- Executes `npx supabase start` to launch local Postgres, Supabase Auth, Storage, and Mailpit containers.
- Applies all migrations and executes `supabase/seed.sql`.
- Generates `apps/api/.env.local` pointing to the local Supabase container and port 3000.
- Generates `apps/owner/.env.local` configuring `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000`, local Supabase credentials, and `EXPO_PUBLIC_STORY_PACK_MODE=live`.

### Step 3: Start the API server
In a separate terminal, start the Hono API server against the local stack:
```sh
npm run dev:api:local
```
The server listens on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 4: Start the Owner App
In another terminal, start the Expo web development server for the owner application:
```sh
npm run dev:owner
```
Open `http://localhost:8081` in your browser.

## 4. Sign In as the Demo Owner

The owner application supports both live authentication against Supabase Auth and an offline demo fallback mode.

### Live Mode (Local Stack)
When configured with `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (set automatically by `scripts/local/up.sh`):
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081`. You will see the **Create your account** screen.
2. Enter the seeded demo owner information:
   - **Name**: `Mario`
   - **Email**: `mario@northside.example`
3. Accept terms and click **Send code**.
4. Open the local email viewer (Mailpit) in your browser:
   - URL: `http://127.0.0.1:54324`
5. Locate the verification email and copy the 6-digit one-time passcode.
6. Enter the 6-digit code on the owner verification screen to sign in.

### Demo Mode (Offline Fallback)
If running without `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, the application operates in in-memory demo mode:
- Onboarding fields are prefilled for the demo owner (`mario@northside.example`).
- Enter the fixed demo verification code: **`482910`**.

## 5. Walk the Demo Flow

Walk through the full end-to-end lifecycle from customer WhatsApp conversation to completed job and content review:

### Step 1: Customer messages Zukki on WhatsApp
Simulate inbound customer WhatsApp interactions using the test runner script:
```sh
node scripts/e2e/wa-customer.mjs http://localhost:3000 text "hi"
```
Or execute turns with the helper script that waits for Zukki's database response:
```sh
scripts/e2e/step.sh http://localhost:3000 text "hi"
```

### Step 2: Emergency guidance, category, and evidence
The customer provides problem details and emergency location:
1. Select plumbing category:
   ```sh
   scripts/e2e/step.sh http://localhost:3000 list cat_plumbing Plumbing
   ```
2. Describe the emergency:
   ```sh
   scripts/e2e/step.sh http://localhost:3000 text "My kitchen sink is leaking under the cabinet, water is on the floor. Can someone come today?"
   ```
3. Confirm safety check:
   ```sh
   scripts/e2e/step.sh http://localhost:3000 button safety_done "Done, no cables"
   ```
4. Share location:
   ```sh
   scripts/e2e/step.sh http://localhost:3000 location 21.1619 -86.8515 "Av. Tulum, Cancún"
   ```
5. Connect with Mario's business (*Northside Emergency Plumbing*, ID `10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001`):
   ```sh
   scripts/e2e/step.sh http://localhost:3000 button "connect:10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001" "Connect me"
   ```

### Step 3: Owner reviews and accepts in Requests tab
1. In the Owner App, click on the **Requests** tab.
2. Under **Waiting for you**, tap **Review request** on the new request.
3. Tap **Accept and chat**. This accepts the offer, opens a proposed job and opens the chat with the customer.

### Step 4: Chat and send quote
1. Inside the conversation thread, notice Zukki's pricing suggestion row: *"Zukki suggests sending the quote"*.
2. Tap **Review** to open the quote composer seeded with suggested pricing ranges.
3. Tap **Send quote**. The quote card is delivered to the customer on WhatsApp.

### Step 5: Customer approves visit
Simulate customer approval from WhatsApp for the quote:
```sh
# The helper run-live.sh script reads the active quote id and triggers approval:
scripts/e2e/step.sh http://localhost:3000 button "quote_approve:<quote_id>" "Approve visit"
```
The job transitions to `customer_approved`.

### Step 6: Track in Jobs tab and finish work
1. Navigate to the **Jobs** tab in the Owner App.
2. The approved job appears in the active jobs list.
3. Open the job to advance the operational lifecycle: start the trip, arrive on site, and complete the job via **Finish job**.

### Step 7: Content tab draft review
1. Switch to the **Content** tab.
2. Zukki automatically drafts social marketing posts from finished, consented jobs and pricing rules.
3. Review the drafted before-and-after story/post, inspect generated copy, and approve or schedule publication.

## 6. Automated Live Flow and Verification Checks

### Automated End-to-End Live Runner
Run the automated end-to-end suite combining signed webhook execution and Maestro UI flows against the local stack:
```sh
bash scripts/e2e/run-live.sh
```
*Note: Requires openjdk@17 / Maestro installed for native UI validation.*

### Suite Checks
Run the project's standard verification checks:
- **Unit and integration test suite**:
  ```sh
  npm test
  ```
- **TypeScript strict compilation**:
  ```sh
  npm run typecheck
  ```
- **Database migrations and RLS verification**:
  ```sh
  npm run test:db
  ```
  *(Requires Docker to spin up a clean PostGIS instance and execute all migration scripts and `.test.sql` assertions).*

---

## 7. Known Limits

Current architectural and deployment limits to keep in mind:
- **Hosted Deployment**: Full production cloud hosting is not pre-configured; local execution relies on the containerized Supabase stack.
- **Hosted Supabase Email Auth**: When deploying to a hosted Supabase project, you must enable the **Email** provider in *Authentication → Providers → Email* with "Confirm email" toggled on. Crucially, the **Magic Link** and **Confirm sign up** email templates must both include `{{ .Token }}` so Supabase emits the 6-digit numerical code rather than only an HTTP magic link.
- **Push Notifications on Real Devices**: Remote push notification registration in `apps/owner` requires adding `extra.eas.projectId` into `apps/owner/app.json` and generating a custom Expo development build (`eas build`). In standard Expo Go or Expo web without an EAS project ID, push tokens are omitted.

## 8. Run the Owner App on a Phone (Android APK, iOS)

App identifiers: `com.owlhours.zukki.owner` on both platforms (`apps/owner/app.json`). Build profiles live in `apps/owner/eas.json`.

A phone cannot reach `localhost`. Before any of the options below, point the app at an API and Supabase the phone can reach: either your laptop's LAN IP on the same Wi-Fi (edit `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` in `apps/owner/.env.local`, replacing `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`), or a deployed API and hosted Supabase.

### Option A: Expo Go (fastest, no build)
1. Install Expo Go on the phone ([docs](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/expo-go/)).
2. From `apps/owner`, run `npx expo start` and scan the QR code.
Limit: remote push notifications do not work in Expo Go on Android.

### Option B: Android APK with EAS Build (cloud)
1. `npm install -g eas-cli`, then `eas login` with the team's Expo account.
2. From `apps/owner`, run `eas init` once. It writes `extra.eas.projectId` into `app.json`, which push notifications also need.
3. `eas build -p android --profile preview` builds an installable `.apk` (profile `preview` sets `"buildType": "apk"`) and prints a download link and QR code.
Docs: [Build APKs](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/apk/), [eas.json](https://docs.expo.dev/build/eas-json/).

### Option C: iOS
- Simulator, no Apple account: from `apps/owner`, `npx expo run:ios` (needs Xcode).
- Your own iPhone, free signing: `npx expo run:ios --device` with the iPhone connected; the install expires after 7 days.
- Other people's iPhones or TestFlight: needs the Apple Developer Program. Then `eas build -p ios --profile preview` (internal distribution, registered devices) or `--profile production` plus `eas submit -p ios`.
Docs: [Local app development](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/), [Internal distribution](https://docs.expo.dev/build/internal-distribution/).

### Development builds
The `development` profile builds a dev client with push support. It requires the `expo-dev-client` package (`npx expo install expo-dev-client` from `apps/owner`), which is not installed yet.
